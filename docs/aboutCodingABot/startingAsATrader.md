I started coding trading bots at the university (back in 2004) but didn't become profitable until recently.
Sounds worse than it is, i had a 7 year break, but still. There is a lesson here. thread incoming. 1/

A friend got me into the financial world and i had a theoretical go on everything.
Started with futures (motivated by the turtles system) and later moved to FOREX.
I tried to learn all the indicators, all the strategies, applied and combined every indicator i could find. 2/

(mathematician: i love systems and theories) But with low budget i basically never really traded. 
All systems where backtested (and curvefitted) to the max.
Sometimes even ran in forwardtests (on paper accounts), but they never made it to a live system. 3/

They just never fulfilled my performance and risk goals in the forward tests. 
and i wasn't in a position to "just risk it".
IMHO one of the main things you need to start trading: "fuck it"-money for your first trading accounts. 
Because lets face it: you will burn them. 4/

And you need the mentality to just risk it. 
You need to be fine with "investing" that trading account into your education.
If you get profitable before its gone: perfect. 
But if not, your reaction must be "i learned definitly more than i lost, so thats fine". 5/

OTOH, not risking real money back then made me learn a lot about trading, the theory and the markets without actually losing money.
By backtesting hundreds of strategies you see how different models of riskmanagement, moneymanagement and performance numbers behave. 6/

I even wrote my own exchange with matching-engine and market-maker to get some deeper understanding of it all.
And still, with all that knowledge and experience: when i started trading real money i burned it. 7/

Still risk averse as fuck, so not much in absolute numbers. but more than 1 account. 
I would def have lost far more if i didn't know the importance (and ways) of RM.
But without putting money on the line, without knowing the man in the mirror, your knowledge is worthless. 8/

So if you think about going that road: read all you can. learn the basics (specially riskmanagement) that make the difference between gambling and trading.
And then make a plan, put money on the line and get your feet wet. there is no way around it. 9/

If ppl like this thread, i will tell you how i made my plan, how it failed and then worked out. how i got profitable and whatever you wanna know about it. just leave a comment.
