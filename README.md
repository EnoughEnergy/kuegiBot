# Kuegi Bot

a simple tradingbot for BTCUSD with connectors for [bybit](https://bit.ly/2rxuv8l "Bybit Homepage") and [bitmex](https://bit.ly/2G4gSB2 "Bitmex Homepage").
It just implements my manual tradingstrategy and therefore helps me to stick to the system. 
No financial advice. Don't use it if you don't understand what it does. You probably will loose money

## getting started

right now this is a pure profi tool for my personal use. if you find the code useful thats nice, but don't expect it to be easy to understand or work with it. There basically exists no documentation at all.

## roots

started with code from https://github.com/BitMEX/sample-market-maker (connector to bitmex mainly but got to change a lot)
